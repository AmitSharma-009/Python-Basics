## 📚 Assignment Tasks Covered

1. ✅ Calculate the **sum, difference, product, and quotient** of two numbers  
2. ✅ Perform **assignment operations** (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)  
3. ✅ Use **comparison operators** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)  
4. ✅ Demonstrate **logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
5. ✅ Test the **identity of variables** using `is` and `==`  
6. ✅ Apply **unary operators** to change number signs  
7. ✅ Perform **bitwise operations** (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`)  
8. ✅ Use the **ternary operator** for conditional assignments
